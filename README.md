This is a simple command-line interface program that generates a random list (of user specified length) of Go language features/associated tools. The goal is to provide the user with a concrete set of features/tools that they must incorporate into their next project. This will hopefully help users learn and/or better their of understanding of Go and how to use these features and tools more effectively.
